# UI Spec Skill

Manages UI spec design documents. Supports viewing, annotating, updating screens, and managing annotations through an interactive browser-based workflow.

## UI Spec File

Location: `.claude/design/ui-spec.html`

## HTML Conventions

- Every `.section` (flow) has a descriptive `id` starting with `flow-`
- Every `.screen` has a descriptive `id` starting with `screen-`
- All colors use CSS custom properties
- Design notes use `.note` class (yellow border, for design documentation)
- Annotations use `.annotation` class (blue border, for feedback/review)

## Screen ID Convention

Screens and flows use descriptive kebab-case IDs:

```
flow-onboarding        # A user flow grouping related screens
screen-login           # Individual screen within a flow
screen-dashboard       # Another screen
```

When adding screens, choose IDs that clearly describe the screen's purpose.

## Annotation Format

```html
<!-- Screen-level: inside .screen-body, at the bottom -->
<div class="annotation" data-author="author" data-date="YYYY-MM-DD" data-priority="high">
  Annotation text here.
</div>

<!-- Flow-level: inside .section, before .screens -->
<div class="annotation" data-author="author" data-date="YYYY-MM-DD">
  Annotation text here.
</div>
```

### Attributes

| Attribute | Required | Values |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| `data-author` | Yes | `alice`, `claude`, etc. |
| `data-date` | Yes | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `data-priority` | No | `high`, `medium`, `low` |
| `data-status` | No | `open` (default), `resolved`, `wontfix` |

## Blank Screen Template

```html
<div class="screen" id="screen-{name}">
  <div class="screen-label">{Label Text}</div>
  <div class="screen-body">
    <div class="status-bar"><span>9:41</span><span>100%</span></div>
    <!-- Screen content here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

## Interactive Annotation Mode

The UI spec has a built-in interactive annotation tool in the browser:

1. Click the **pencil button** in the top-right toolbar to enter annotate mode
2. **Hover** over elements to see highlight outlines
3. **Click** any element to open the annotation form
4. Write feedback, set priority, and save
5. Annotation is injected into the DOM as a real `.annotation` div at the right position
6. Click **save button** to download the modified HTML with all annotations embedded
7. User replaces `.claude/design/ui-spec.html` with the download
8. Claude reads the file and sees all annotations in their spatial context

### Workflow: User annotates → Claude reads → Claude executes

```
Browser: User clicks elements, adds annotations, downloads HTML
         ↓
File:    User replaces ui-spec.html with downloaded version
         ↓
Claude:  /ui-spec → reads file → sees annotations inside their parent screens
         ↓
Claude:  Proposes changes based on annotation context → /ui-spec update
```

### Badge counter
The pencil button shows a red badge with the count of open (unresolved) annotations.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `A` | Toggle annotate mode (same as pencil button) |
| `S` | Save/download HTML (same as save button) |
| `T` | Toggle dark/light theme |
| `1` | Switch to Mobile viewport (375px) |
| `2` | Switch to Tablet viewport (768px) |
| `3` | Switch to Desktop viewport (1440px) |
| `Escape` | Cancel annotation form / exit annotate mode |

Shortcuts are disabled when the annotation form is focused (to avoid conflicts with typing).

## Theme System

The UI spec supports dark/light themes via CSS variables. When adding or modifying content:
- Use `var(--bg-*)` for backgrounds
- Use `var(--text-*)` for text colors
- Use `var(--border-*)` for borders
- Use `var(--accent)` for the primary theme color
- Character/brand-specific colors can remain as inline styles

## Viewport System

### Viewport Sizes

| Name | Width | Use case |
|------|-------|----------|
| Mobile | 375px | Phone (default) |
| Tablet | 768px | Tablet portrait |
| Desktop | 1440px | Desktop browser |

### Viewport Toggle (Toolbar)

The toolbar includes three viewport buttons that switch the container width:

```html
<!-- In toolbar, after existing buttons -->
<div class="viewport-toggle">
  <button class="vp-btn active" data-vp="mobile" title="Mobile 375px">📱</button>
  <button class="vp-btn" data-vp="tablet" title="Tablet 768px">📋</button>
  <button class="vp-btn" data-vp="desktop" title="Desktop 1440px">🖥️</button>
</div>
```

Switching viewport sets a `data-viewport` attribute on `<body>` and adjusts `.screen` width:

```css
/* Default: mobile */
.screen-body { width: 375px; }

body[data-viewport="tablet"] .screen-body { width: 768px; }
body[data-viewport="desktop"] .screen-body { width: 1440px; }
```

Screens use **flex/relative layout** inside `.screen-body` so content reflows naturally at wider widths. Use percentage widths and `max-width` where appropriate.

### Viewport Group (Optional)

When mobile and desktop layouts are **structurally different** (e.g., bottom tab bar vs sidebar navigation), use a viewport group to show multiple variants:

```html
<div class="viewport-group" id="screen-dashboard-variants">
  <div class="screen" id="screen-dashboard-mobile" data-viewport="mobile">
    <div class="screen-label">Dashboard (Mobile)</div>
    <div class="screen-body">
      <!-- Bottom tab bar layout -->
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="screen" id="screen-dashboard-desktop" data-viewport="desktop">
    <div class="screen-label">Dashboard (Desktop)</div>
    <div class="screen-body">
      <!-- Sidebar layout -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.viewport-group {
  display: flex; gap: 2rem; flex-wrap: wrap;
}
.viewport-group .screen { flex: none; }
```

**Rule**: Only use viewport-group when layouts are structurally incompatible. For most screens, CSS reflow via the viewport toggle is sufficient.

## Source Code Reading Conventions (for capture mode)

When generating screens from an existing project's source code:

1. **Project config** → `package.json`, framework config → identify tech stack
2. **Router/navigation** → route definitions → build page list
3. **Page components** → read the full source of each page component, then **recursively read every imported child component** — never assume what a component looks like without reading its file
4. **Style sources** → CSS modules, Tailwind classes, styled-components, theme files → extract **exact** colors, spacing, typography, border-radius values — no approximations
5. **Shared components** → design system primitives (Button, Card, Input, etc.) → read their source to understand exact rendering, don't substitute generic versions

### The 1:1 Replication Rule

For projects with an existing frontend, capture mode is a **strict replication** task:

- **Read, don't imagine**: If you haven't read the component file, you don't know what it looks like. Open it.
- **Exact values**: Use the actual `#hex` colors, `px`/`rem` spacing, and font sizes from the source. Don't round, normalize, or "improve" them.
- **Actual text**: Use the real button labels, headings, placeholder text from the code. Never substitute with "Button", "Title", or "Lorem ipsum".
- **Complete elements**: Every visible element (icons, badges, dividers, empty states, tooltips) that the component renders should appear in the spec. Don't simplify by removing "minor" elements.
- **Faithful layout**: Replicate the actual flex/grid/positioning from the styles. Don't rearrange elements for "better" aesthetics.
- **No editorial changes**: Don't "fix" inconsistencies, improve spacing, or redesign anything. Replicate as-is.

The goal is: someone comparing the spec to the running app should find them visually equivalent. This is code-reading forensics, not design.

## Quick Start

To create a UI spec for your project:

1. Run `/ui-spec init` to generate a starter `ui-spec.html`
2. Run `/ui-spec capture` to generate screens from an existing project's source code
3. Open it in a browser to view and annotate
4. Use `/ui-spec` to manage it from Claude Code
